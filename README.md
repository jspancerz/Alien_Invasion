# Alien-Invasion
This is a project called "Alien Invasion!" from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.

The object of the game is to clear the screen of all the enemy invading alien ships.

To start the game simply click the play button in the middle of the screen.

to exit the game you can either click 'x' to close the window in the upper left hand corner or simple press the 'q' key on your keyboard.

You start off the game with 3 ships in total, you can then track your lives throughout your gameplay by looking for the series of ship images in the upper right hand corner of the screen.

At any given point during the game you can fire 3 shots at a time. 

You will lose one of your precious ships if an alien manages to collide into it, or one of the invaders makes it past you completely and reachs the bottom of the screen.

The numbers presented to you in the upper middle section is the the current "high score" for the game.

Continuing along the upper left side of the window will be your current games "score", with the current level stage number displayed directly underneath.

Beware, each time you clear a stage of invaders another fleet will re-appear just as quickly! Your foes will become quicker every level so make sure to time your shots appropriately.
