# Alien-Invasion
This is a project called "Alien Invasion!" from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.


The object of the game is to clear the screen of all the enemy invading alien ships.

To start the game simply click the play button in the middle of the screen.

You can make the ship move "left" and "right" across the screen with the corresponding arrow keys on your keyboard.

To shoot bullets from your ships into the invading fleet of aliens simply press the "space bar" on your keyboard. However, Keep in mind you can only shoot up to three bullets at once.

to exit the game you can either click 'x' to close the window in the upper right hand corner of the window or press the 'q' key on your keyboard.

You start off the game with 3 ships in total, you can then track your lives throughout your gameplay by looking for a group of ship images in the upper left hand corner of the screen. Each ship represents another life remaining.

You will lose one of your precious ships if an alien manages to collide into it, or one of the invaders makes it past you completely and reachs the bottom of the screen.

The numbers presented to you in the upper middle section is the the current "high score" for the game.

Continuing along the upper right side of the window will be your current games "score", with the current level  number displayed directly underneath.

Beware, each time you clear a stage of invaders another fleet will re-appear just as quickly! Your foes will become quicker every level so make sure to time your shots appropriately.

If you do lose all your ships in combat with the alien fleet just click the green "Play" button again to restart.

Thanks for trying out my game, I hope you enjoy it.
